# uConsole-Upgrade-Board

A board to upgrade the uConsole, expanding the GPIO and unused USB with i2c headers and a USB2 hub.

It connects to the 40-pin, 0.5mm pitch GPIO FFC/FPC connector, as well as being soldered to the unallocated USB4 pads. It splits out 3.3V I2C, providing a Qwiic connector (JST-SH) and soldering headers, and also provides a GL850-based USB2 Hub, the 4 ports accessible by soldering headers.
